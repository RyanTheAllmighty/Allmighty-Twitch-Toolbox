Allmighty Twitch Toolbox
====================================

### What is it?
This is a collection of tools and utilities I use for Twitch to tell me such as notifications for new followers and donations as well as providing a simple UI for the broadcaster to use.

### Coding standards & styling guidelines
Please see the STYLE.md file for coding standards and style guidelines.

### Getting Started
To get a Twitch API token for use in the application you can either visit http://www.ryandowling.me/twitch-api-token-generator to generate a token using my site or you can follow the directions on Twitch's API docs (https://github.com/justintv/Twitch-API/blob/master/authentication.md) making sure to grant rights for all scopes when doing so.

For details on setup and information about the inbuilt server used and what you can do with it (such as display notifications on your stream), click the Open Server button on the Settings page to be taken to the index page for the inbuilt server.
