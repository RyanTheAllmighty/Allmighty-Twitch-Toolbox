            </div>

            <div class="panel-body">
                <p>To get started you'll need a few plugins installed in OBS (OBS MultiPlatform not supported). Please download and install them into your OBS:</p>

                <ul>
                    <li><a href="https://obsproject.com/forum/resources/clr-browser-source-plugin.22/" target="_blank">CLR Browser Source</a></li>
                    <li><a href="http://www.obsremote.com/" target="_blank">OBS Remote</a></li>
                </ul>

                <p>You'll also need foobar2000 and a coupple plugins for it in order to access the foobar related things:</p>

                <ul>
                    <li><a href="https://obsproject.com/forum/resources/clr-browser-source-plugin.22/" target="_blank">foobar2000</a></li>
                    <li><a href="http://skipyrich.com/wiki/Foobar2000:Now_Playing_Simple" target="_blank">foo_np_simple</a></li>
                    <li><a href="https://bitbucket.org/oblikoamorale/foo_httpcontrol/downloads" target="_blank">foo_httpcontrol</a></li>
                    <li><a href="https://bitbucket.org/oblikoamorale/foo_httpcontrol/downloads" target="_blank">foo_httpcontrol ajquery</a></li>
                </ul>

                <p>
                    The settings for foo_np_simple can be accessed within foobar under File -> Preferences -> Tools -> Now Playing Simple and should be set as encoding UTF-8 and should only respond to
                    the 'On New Track' event. The Formatting string section should only contain '%path%' without the quotes.
                </p>

                <p>Once installed and OBS and foobar2000 have been restarted you can then go to the 'Settings' tab in this application and setup your settings.</p>

                <p>Once everything is setup, a restart of the application is needed so it can start to pull in all the information it needs to get started.</p>

                <p>To get started with setting up the necessary scenes in OBS, take a look at the below list of the url's of the scenes and their width and height.</p>

                <p>These size settings are based off a 1280x720 broadcasting resolution. If you're using anything but that, you will need to resize your notifications within OBS to suit.</p>

                <p>If you want to have these playing across multiple scenes and not reloading everytime you switch scene, then you should set them up as global sources.</p>

                <ul>
                    <li>Now Playing Scene (175x300): <a href="http://localhost:28800/scenes/nowplaying/" target="_blank">http://localhost:28800/scenes/nowplaying/</a></li>
                    <li>Alerts Scene (600x50): <a href="http://localhost:28800/scenes/alerts/" target="_blank">http://localhost:28800/scenes/alerts/</a></li>
                    <li>Timers Scene (500x125): Click 'Copy Link' on the timer on the Timers tab for the link</li>
